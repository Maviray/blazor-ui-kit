# Blazor UI Component Library

Collection of re-usable Blazor UI components.

## Overview
The idea is to compile simple collection of re-usable Blazor UI components.

## Purpose

- Provide **simple and straightforward** Blazor UI components

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate projects, each representing an independent NuGet package:

```
blazorui/
├── Project1/          # Component library project 1
├── Project2/          # Component library project 2
└── ... 
```

Each project can be installed independently based on your requirements.
