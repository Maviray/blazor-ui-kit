# Blazor UI Component Library

Collection of re-usable Blazor UI components.

## Overview
This is an attempt to centralize lots of previously relatively sparadic efforts to manage and maintain Blazor UI. Hopefully someone might find this useful. This is hardly an effort to compete or replicate effort matching one with professional UI libraries. I really like what MudBlazor folks are doing and have given it a number of serious thought inclining using those libraries. The dilemma is I am also a big fan of Tailwind idea of managing CSS with utility classes and the biggest bummer is that they or any other team i had come across don’t do Tailwind with Blazor components.

## Purpose

- Provide **simple and straightforward** library of Blazor UI components. Mostly for lazy folks who dont want to re-invent a wheel and just need something simple, working and relatively good looking.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate projects, each representing an independent NuGet package:

```
blazor-ui-kit/
├── Maviray.Blazor.Components.Material/          # Component library following Material UI specs
├── Maviray.Blazor.Components.Tailwind/          # Component library implementing Tailwind native UI
└── ... 
```

Each project can be installed independently based on your requirements.
